## About Me
I am a year-4 Ph.D. student in the Individualized Interdisciplinary Program (IIP), majoring in Advanced Materials, at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I am expected to graduate from my current school in 2023 summe. 
I joined [Professor Wen Weijia](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=weijia-wen-phwen)'s research group at HKUST in 2019 and focused on the new materials development and devices in biological applications. Since 2016, I have been the leader of a national scientific research project for three years, advised by [Professor Xie Weiqing](http://groupxie.com), during which time I gained a basic understanding of scientific thinking. To broaden my research scope, I chose interdisciplinary research projects for the majority of my research projects. I am skilled at combining academic theory and practice with creative ability and enthusiasm for applying technology to actual production. 
Throughout my Ph.D. studies, I worked as a teaching assistant in various undergraduate courses. When the COVID-19 pandemic raged worldwide, I volunteered at Customs for the Covid-19 PCR test. The nucleic acid detection chips and test materials I helped design have been used in a large number of tests internationally. I am also skilled in the operation of a variety of scientific instruments.




I am interested in a variety of topics in computer vision and medical image processing.
